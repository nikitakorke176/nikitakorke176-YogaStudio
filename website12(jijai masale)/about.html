      <p> Today I am trying to create my own independent existence. Behind all this is the flame of light, that flame is my family, my situation. I was confronted with a situation that only motivated me to move on. I am a child born into a normal family. My family, in a normal Indian farming community, used to work hard to make gold from the soil and fill our stomachs. Then our education, hospital e. Financial scarcity was our zodiac sign. I was living in the hope of seeing these good days in such a difficult situation. But the situation did not matter to our new hope. Faced with this situation, there was always a situation of stumbling while moving forward. But no matter what happened, I was moving forward with the determination to face this situation. I was living in an area that was and still is a drought. So the cost was higher than the income. Hard work was the only option before my eyes. My parents have never left the village. But even though they were ignorant, they were well aware that this situation would change only if their children should learn. He was working hard with the same dream. So that our children should be educated.<br>

The same hope was taught by the parents with hard work. Never did we realize that our situation was tweaking our stomachs. Educating children on a wage basis and running a family of five or seven was not easy. But he was living in the hope that something would happen next. My parents knew that no one's situation was right. He was making a living for all of us by doing what he needed to do. My older brother was in charge of the family, standing firmly behind my father. Undeterred, he completed the education of two siblings. To this day I have experienced many things in this life journey but I have not been disappointed.<br>

I realized that if you want to do something in life, you have no choice but to work hard. But everyone wanted to get a job after completing their education. But I was adamant about not doing the job. But if you want to do / do business, you need capital, if you look at the situation at home, you would not get capital. So I decided that what I really needed to do was learn how to do it right. But if you want to do business, what people have to do every day, it should not be used again and it should be done by going to a certain place. In the same vein, I launched Jijai Masale Pvt. Ltd. Founded a company by this name. And I decided that what I really needed to do was learn how to do it right. Our journey continues on the same lines. The journey of this company today is due to the progress of the company due to my employees and my customers. We have always benefited from the blessings of our customers and we hope that they will continue to do so! #My staff my strength # #My customers my strengths # The customer is the king, And to lend to the king.<br>

We don't have enough. Yours Faithful, Director Babasaheb Jijai Masale Pvt. Ltd. Customer - Read!</p>
